# Data-Cleaning-of-EDA-using-SQL

In this project I analysed a dataset I got from 'Real World Fake Data' using SQL then we visualize it using Tableau.

The link to the dataset (file is also uploaded for reference) : https://data.world/markbradbourne/rwfd-real-world-fake-data/workspace/file?filename=Call+Center.csv

Steps we did :
* Download the csv file.
* Import the file to MySQL
* Clean it a bit (since it's pretty clean to start with)
* Perform EDA
* Visualize it using Tableau.
